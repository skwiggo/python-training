# Exercise 4: Basic maths

# In the previous exercise we did some very simple addition to integers. In this exercise we will take this further
# to explore some of Python's mathematical operators to do some very basic maths.

# We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*) and division (/) on integers.

# When we divide - what happens if we divide with a remainder and end up without a whole number?
# We learnt in the last exercise that integers are whole numbers!

# It seems now is a good time to introduce the integer's sibling type - the float! A float represents a number
# that is not whole and has a decimal point - (e.g. 1.2, 1.3456, 3456.2225).

# There are a couple of other interesting operators we can use:

# Power (**) allows us to do power calculations (e.g. 10 to the power of 3 is the equivalent of 10 * 10 * 10)

# Modulo (%) divides two integers together and gives us back the remainder (e.g. 10 % 2 would equal 0 as
# there is no remainder, 10 % 3 would equal 1)

# Floor division (//) divides two integers and returns the result minus any decimal point. (e.g. 5 % 3 would return 1)

# Python mathematical operators also work on negative numbers. Give it a go after you have
# finished the main tasks to see what happens!

# In this exercise I would like you to:

# 1. Add 300 and 25 together and print to the screen.
# 2. Subtract 50 from 2000 and print to the screen.
# 3. Multiply 26 by 30 and print to the screen.
# 4. Divide 1000 by 50 and print to the screen.
# 5. Print 40 to the power of 5 to the screen.
# 6. Print 100 modulo 30 to the screen.
# 7. Floor divide 9 by 4 and print to the screen.
