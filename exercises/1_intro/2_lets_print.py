# Exercise 2: Lets print!

# The goal of this exercise is to build on the previous 'Hello world!' application.

# We saw in the last exercise that we can print words to the screen using the print() function.

# This time I want you to print multiple sentences to the screen using the print() function.

# First I want you to print "Hello world!" to the screen again.

# Next I want you to print 5 different facts about yourself to the screen:
    # 1. Your name ("My name is ...")
    # 2. Your age ("My age is ...")
    # 3. The town you live in ("I live in ...")
    # 4. Your favourite band ("My favourite band is ...")
    # 5. Your favourite curry ("My favourite curry is ...")

# Before tackling this exercise - speak to your programming buddy. They will be able to guide you
# through the problem so you can come to an effective solution!

    # Implement some code here!
