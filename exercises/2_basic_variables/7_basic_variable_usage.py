Exercise 7 - Basic variable usage

So we have learnt what variables are in the last exercise. However you may be wondering
at this point - why do we need them? What benefits can they have? Well look no further! In this exercise we will
see how variables can be extremely useful when we need to store and reuse data.

Many of the things we have done in the intro exercises can be combined with variables to show their power.

Example 1:

my_variable = 2
my_second_variable = 12

Above we have created two variables set to the value of integers. We can now use these variables
as many times as we want throughout our programs just by referencing them.

For instance we can perform mathematical operations on them:

print(my_variable + my_second_variable) = 14
print(my_variable + my_variable + my_variable) = 6
print(my_second_variable - my_variable) = 10
print (my_second_variable + my_variable - my variable) = 14

Example 2:

animal_one = "sheep"
animal_two = "goat"

Now we have created two variables set to the value of strings. As seen in exercise 3 "strings and ints"
we can combine strings together to form new strings using the "+" operator.

print("I love my " + animal_one) = "I love my sheep"
print("I love my " + animal_two) = "I love my goat"
print("I love my " + animal_one + " and my " + animal_two) = "I love my sheep and my goat"
print(animal_one + " " + animal_two + " " + animal_one + " " + animal_two) = "sheep goat sheep goat"

As you can see the value of the variables does not change when we do these operations which means we can
reuse them as many times as we like.

These simple examples show how variables can be useful when we need to reuse data.

Task time!

part 1:

1. Create a variable named my_number and set it to the integer 5
2. Create another variable named my_other_number and set it to the integer 17
3. Print out these calculations using the two variables you just created:
    5 multiplied by 17
    17 minus 5
    17 to the power of 5
    5 add 5 add 5 add 17
    17 divided by 5
    17 floor divided by 5
    17 modulo 5 multiplied by 5

part 2:

1. Create a variable named my_name and set it to your own name as a string
2. Create a variable named my_age and set it to your own age as an string
3. Create a variable named my_colour and set it to your favourite colour as a string
4. Print out the string "My name is <my_name>, my age is <my_age> and my favourite colour is <my_colour>" -
injecting the three variables you just created into the string.

part 3:

4. Create a variable named annoying_song and set it to the string "I know a song that gets on everybodys nerves,
everybodys nerves, everybodys nerves!"
5. Print out the annoying_song 5 times to the console.
6. BONUS! How would you easily print out the annoying_song 100 times efficiently?
Tricky but think about it and give it a go!
